The process for setting it up to run the first time for each user is
cumbersome.  After the initial user set-up it works well without much
fuss.

# login as self
# make file .mpd.conf  vi/emacs/pico .mpd.conf    
# in it write one line:
secretword=<secretword>

where <secretword> is a secure key you create but not your normal password
save the file. You may write:
secretword=css534

# set the correct permissions on this file (other permissions won't work)
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

# create the mpd.hosts file in your "home" directory. The file should
include a list of cssmpi machines as seen in /home/mfukuda/css534/mpiJava/mpd.hosts:
cssmpi2.uwb.edu
cssmpi3.uwb.edu
cssmpi4.uwb.edu

Note that you should not include cssmpi1 where you are logging in.

# edit .bash_profile file as follows:

export PATH=/usr/apps/mpich121-`uname -p`/bin:$PATH
export JAVAPATH=/usr/java/latest
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib/classes:.
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/lib
export PATH=/usr/apps/mpiJava-`uname -p`/src/scripts:$JAVAPATH/bin:$PATH

# either relogin or type at the command line:
# source .bash_profile

# test that your set-up works on the current host
mpd &
mpiexec -n 1 /bin/hostname
mpdallexit

# if you get an error or warning this is a problem.  
# You should get the hostname of your current host

**  Need to be able to ssh without a password to other machines in order to
use MPICH.  If this is not already set up:
**************************************************************************
**  ssh-keygen -t rsa                                                   **
**  #  at "Enter file in which to save key", <enter> to accept default  **
**  #  at "Enter passphrase" <enter> to keep the passphrase empty.      **
**  #  do the same thing again                                          **
**  #  then go to the .ssh directory                                    **
**  # and change the name of id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys              **
**  cd .ssh                                                             **
**  mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys                                       **
**  # ssh to all lab machines to set up                                 **
**  # first ssh need to respond "yes" to "continue connecting"          **
**************************************************************************

The first time a new host is added to the first "ring"; it needs to be
established by a "yes" response to "continue connecting".  Every time the
output hangs, type "yes".

Once you have added all the hosts in this way, you never have to type
"yes" again, they were all established for mpich.

Thereafter, you can launch mpd at all nodes. Type the following
commands from your home directory: 
mfukuda@cssmpi1 ~]$ CSSmpdboot -n 4 -v

Preparing...
Starting Master's mpd Process...
Starting node: cssmpi2
Starting node: cssmpi3
Starting node: cssmpi4
Cluster built:
cssmpi1_46768 (172.28.203.196)
CSSmpdboot finished!
[mfukuda@cssmpi1 ~]$

To make sure if all mpds are running, type:
[mfukuda@cssmpi1 ~]$ mpiexec -n 4 /bin/hostname
cssmpi4
cssmpi1
cssmpi2
cssmpi3
[mfukuda@cssmpi1 ~]$

Now, you are ready to run a mpiJava program.
To compile:
javac *.java

To run 
CSSmpdboot -n #cpus -v
./java_mpirun.sh #cpus Hello
./java_mpirun.sh #cpus MatrixMult size
./java_mpirun.sh #cpus MyProgram

To stop
mpdallexit

Whenever you log off, don't forget to type mpdallexit.
